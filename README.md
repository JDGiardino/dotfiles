# JDGiardino's dotfiles
My personal bash profiles and configurations for setting up my system as I like.  This was written for Mac OS but should work on Linux as well.


## Install
Run the following commands within terminal. This will clone the repositoiry and run the primary installation script.  

It should prompt the user before it actually installs anything. 

```
git clone https://github.com/JDGiardino/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
chmod +x install_dotfiles.sh
./install_dotfiles.sh
